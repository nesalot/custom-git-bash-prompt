# My Windows Git Bash Settings

I use MAC OS 90% of the time for Development work, Trying to also be proficient at Windows Development and hone in similar settings on Windows that I use for MAC. I installed Git Bash instead of using Powershell or CMD so I could keep muscle memory workflows. 

I have spent countless hours building out a custom `.bashrc` file instead of using ZSH (because I wanted to learn) that will give me a custom terminal prompt that I enjoy that includes username, directory and git information. This was all coded by me for learning purposes.

Once I get it more finalized I will come back and add screenshots for visual reference. 

Windows Terminals I've been using:
- Windows Terminal
- Warp for Windows (which I've been loving the AI features)
